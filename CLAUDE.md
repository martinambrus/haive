# Haive

Deterministic multi-CLI orchestration and AI agentic workflow utility. Reimplements a legacy markdown-driven Claude Code workflow, the autonomous `/workflow` implementation loop, and a sandboxed local environment replication step set as a deterministic web project. Agentic CLI invocations only happen for parts that genuinely need reasoning. Everything else runs as TypeScript step modules with web forms.

The legacy markdown step content has been ported into TypeScript step modules under `packages/worker/src/step-engine/steps/`. The original source archive is no longer vendored in the repo.

## Stack

- pnpm workspace monorepo, turborepo
- Node 24, TypeScript 5.7, ES2024 target, NodeNext modules
- Hono 4 REST API on port 3001
- Next.js 16 + React 19 + Tailwind 4 web UI on port 3000
- Drizzle ORM on PostgreSQL 18, postgres.js driver
- BullMQ on Redis 8 (noeviction policy is required)
- Uploaded repo archives live in the `haive_repos` named volume (shared by api and worker); Mailpit for dev SMTP
- Docker Compose orchestrates everything; `docker compose up` is the only supported boot path
- clawker (Apache 2.0 Go binary) wrapped via child_process for per-task Docker sandboxes; pinned at worker image build time

## Package boundaries

- `@haive/shared` holds zod schemas, types, crypto, logger, ConfigService, SecretsService, and UserSecretsService. May be imported by every other server-side package. May import `@haive/database` for the Drizzle schema namespace used by the secrets services; the actual db client is injected at runtime via `initialize(db)` so shared never instantiates a connection.
- `@haive/database` exports the Drizzle schema and a `createDatabase(url)` factory. Instantiated only by the api and worker packages.
- `@haive/api` is HTTP + WebSocket only. It must never spawn child processes for CLI execution; that responsibility lives in the worker.
- `@haive/worker` owns BullMQ queues, the step engine, the CLI adapter registry, the sandbox/clawker wrapper, and the dispatcher priority chain. It holds no HTTP routes.
- `@haive/web` consumes only the public REST API of `@haive/api`. It must not import from `@haive/database` or `@haive/worker`.

## Architecture summary

Three queues on Redis:

- `task-queue` runs the orchestrator. One job per task. Owns the step machine and persists every transition to Postgres.
- `cli-exec-queue` runs the sandbox worker. One job per CLI invocation. Spawns clawker, attaches PTY, streams output via Redis pub/sub.
- `env-replicate-queue` runs Dockerfile builds for environment replication.

State source of truth is Postgres. Every step transition, every CLI invocation, every form submission is a row. Crash recovery reads the last row.

## Step engine

Every legacy markdown step becomes a `StepDefinition<TInput, TOutput>` with four phases:

1. `detect` runs first. Pure or shells out via clawker. No LLM. Always runs.
2. `form` returns a `FormSchema`. The web UI renders the schema and the user submits values.
3. `llm` is optional. Spawns a CLI invocation through the dispatcher. For CLIs without native sub-agents the splitter emits a sequential script.
4. `apply` runs last. Writes outputs to `task_steps.output` and to actual files under the workspace.

Step lifecycle: `pending` to `running(detect)` to `waiting_form` to `running(apply)` to optional `waiting_cli` then back to `running(apply)` to `done` or `failed` or `skipped`.

## CLI adapter system

`packages/worker/src/cli-adapters/base-adapter.ts` defines `BaseCliAdapter`. Initial adapters: `claude-code`, `codex`, `gemini`, `amp`, `grok`, `qwen`, `kiro`, `zai`. Each declares `supportsSubagents`, `supportsApi`, `supportsCliAuth`. The dispatcher resolves execution via a priority chain: subscription CLI to BYOK API to platform API to CLI fallback to skip.

The sub-agent emulator splits a single sub-agent specification into either a native `Task()` call (Claude Code) or a sequential prompt script (everything else). State persists between sub-steps in `cli_invocations` rows so a crash mid-script can resume.

## Sandbox

`packages/worker/src/sandbox/clawker-client.ts` wraps the clawker binary. The worker container mounts `/var/run/docker.sock` and uses Docker-in-Docker to spawn per-task containers. Only the cloned repository is bind-mounted into the per-task container. The worker filesystem and the user home directory are never exposed. CLI authentication files are copied into a named volume per task at startup and the volume is destroyed at task end.

## Build commands

- `pnpm install` installs all workspace dependencies.
- `pnpm build` runs `turbo run build` across the workspace; `@haive/shared` and `@haive/database` build first because all other packages depend on them.
- `pnpm typecheck` runs `tsc --noEmit` everywhere.
- `pnpm test` runs Vitest across the workspace.
- `pnpm test:e2e` runs Playwright against the dev compose stack.
- `pnpm db:push` runs `drizzle-kit push` against the database in `DATABASE_URL`.
- `pnpm docker:dev` boots `docker-compose.yml` plus the dev override.
- `pnpm docker:down` stops everything.

The api and worker packages depend at build time on `@haive/shared` and `@haive/database`. Always build those two first when running anything outside of turbo.

## Conventions

- All modules are `"type": "module"`. Use `.js` extensions in import paths even for TypeScript sources because of `NodeNext` module resolution.
- Zod is used for both validation and for generating `FormSchema` field metadata where possible.
- Logger is `pino` from `@haive/shared/logger`. Never `console.log` from server code.
- Secrets are stored via envelope encryption: per-user DEK encrypts the secret, master KEK from `CONFIG_ENCRYPTION_KEY` encrypts the DEK. AES-256-GCM throughout.
- Drizzle schema lives in `packages/database/src/schema/`. Migrations in `packages/database/src/migrations/` are generated via `drizzle-kit generate` and applied via `drizzle-kit push`.
- Hono routes group by domain in `packages/api/src/routes/`. Auth middleware mounts globally.
- Forms are described by `FormSchema` from `@haive/shared` and rendered by `FormRenderer` in `@haive/web`. Do not write step-specific React components.

## Where things live

- Step modules: `packages/worker/src/step-engine/steps/{onboarding,workflow,env-replicate}/`
- CLI adapters: `packages/worker/src/cli-adapters/`
- Sandbox wrapper: `packages/worker/src/sandbox/`
- Terminal proxy: `packages/api/src/routes/terminal.ts` plus `packages/web/src/components/terminal/`
- Orchestrator state machine: `packages/worker/src/orchestrator/state-machine.ts`
- Dispatcher priority chain: `packages/worker/src/orchestrator/dispatcher.ts`

## Phasing

Phase 0 scaffold is complete when `pnpm install` and `pnpm docker:dev` boot all services on a clean host with only Docker installed. Subsequent phases build the database schemas, auth, repository management, CLI adapters, sandbox, terminal proxy, step engine, sub-agent emulator, autonomous workflow, and environment replication in that order. See the project plan in `/home/zathrus/.claude/plans/vivid-greeting-stroustrup.md` for the full sequence.

## Constraints

- WSL2 plus Docker is the only supported developer environment. No Windows-native installs.
- Never run more than 7 concurrent worker tasks; WSL crashes under heavier parallelism.
- The Docker socket mount in the worker container is effectively root on the host. Document this in the README and offer rootless Docker instructions in Phase 9 hardening.
- All step content lives in TypeScript modules. Do not pipe legacy markdown into a CLI prompt.
